# Data__Collection
This is a repository containing my code to scrape the website: https://www.fishwatch.gov/

Milestone 1:
Initially, my task was to find a website that firstly, I was interested in, and secondly that was set up to be scraped. 
I decided on the website 'Fishwatch' due to my love of animals. Additionally, the data shown in the website could be useful grouped and displayed in a table format which is why I proceeded with this website.

Milestone 2:
In this milestone I created a Scraper class to create methods to extract the data from the website 'Fishwatch'
